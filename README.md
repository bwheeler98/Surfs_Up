# Surfs_Up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL Alchemy to query the data for the temperatures, stations, and precipitation for Hawaii in order to determine whether or not the location for the surf & ice cream shop would be successful.  We queried for the tempertaures for June and July to compare these two months.

## Results

- There was about 200 more temperature observations in the month of June compared to December.
- The average temperature in June was only slightly higher than the average temperature in Decemeber.  This is good for the shop since it shows that the weather is somewhat consistent throughout th year.
- The minimum temperature in December was colder than the minimum temperature in June by 8 degrees.  The maximum temperature in June was higher than the maximum temperature in December by only 2 degrees.

## Summary

In conclusion, the analysis was successful in that it shows there is consistent weather no matter the time of year.  This is very important for a surf shop that also sells ice cream.  There are some additional queries that can be performed that will improve the analysis.  One query could be for the June and December temperatures based on the observation station location.  This will give more of an idea for the precise location of the shop.  Another query could be for the June and December temperatures based on the precipitation received, for the amount of precipitation affects the temperatures.
